    <h1>Why I Might Be a Good Fit for inManage</h1>

    <p>Hi! I'm Matan. I built this project as part of the application process for inManage. Beyond completing the assignment, I wanted to take a moment to share why I’d love to join your team:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>I'm a quick and curious learner</strong> – I’ve built this entire project while diving deep into PHP, MySQL, and OOP best practices.</li>
        <li><strong>Attention to detail</strong> – from structured code to modular design and error handling, I care about clean and readable work.</li>
        <li><strong>Team player</strong> – I love building things with people and am always open to feedback and learning from others.</li>
        <li><strong>Real excitement</strong> – I enjoyed this challenge and it genuinely made me more excited about the possibility of working at inManage.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Thank you for considering me. If you've gotten this far, I appreciate your time!</p>
